### Overview
At its best, the internet is a magnificent pool of information and knowledge. Let’s contribute to it. For this assignment, think of something you’d like to teach the class to do. It can be small (how to tie a ribbon on a gift) or large (how to get the most out of your education?) but should exercise an editorial point of view. 

Think about how you can use a combination of language, imagery, interactivity, and design to instruct someone to do something. The audience is also helpful to consider – how does your tone of voice change based on who the skill is for? Consider how the website might evolve if you were to expand the audience, or specify it even further.
